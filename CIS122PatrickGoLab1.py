# Purpose: To demosntrate how to create your first Python Program

#Program uses: to become familiar with debugging process, recognizing syntax errors, using IDLE

#Part 1:
def main():
    print("Hello World!")
    print("My favorite food is pizza.", " Hello Professor Ferguson!")
    print("Isn't Python Great? ") #Use double quotation marks
    print("Python is one of the \nmost popular programming languages")
main()


#Part 2:

#print (“My name is _________")
#The syntax error is with the quotations used for the print statement. This was debugged by replacing the quotation marks

#print("a“ 7);
#The error here is there is no comma to separate "a" with 7.

#print(1, "b);
#The error here is the quotation marks for b are not closed.

#print(2, "c", 3);
#The error here is there is an invalid character at the end of the print statement ;

#Print “F", 5
#The error here is print() is capitalized, and does not have a following parenthesis
